You can add or remove more sections to this template. To add a new section, copy the formatting in \texttt{main.tex} and create a new \texttt{.tex} file under the \texttt{./sections/} directory. To remove an existing section, simply delete the corresponding items in \texttt{main.tex} and delete the file in \texttt{./sections/} directory.

More examples and instructions to modify this coming soon.
